Description:
"E-commerce" is a dynamic, user-friendly e-commerce website designed to offer a seamless shopping experience. Built using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it connects to the Fake Store API to display a variety of products. This website provides users with the ability to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and manage their cart efficiently, with real-time updates for the total bill.

Key Features:
1.Product Display:
  *The homepage showcases a wide variety of products fetched dynamically from the Fake Store API.
  *Each product is displayed within a neatly designed product card that includes the product name, price, and an image.
  *A hover effect enhances the user experience by subtly enlarging the product image and adding a shadow when hovering over a product, creating a visually engaging interaction.
2.Search Functionality:
  *A search bar allows users to quickly filter through the list of products by entering keywords.
  *As users type, the product list dynamically updates to show only the items that match the search criteria.
3.Shopping Cart:

  *The cart updates in real-time to reflect the items added, the quantities, and the price of each item.
  *Cart management features allow users to increase or decrease the quantity of items or remove them from the cart entirely.
4.Dynamic Total Bill Calculation:
  *The website calculates the total cost of items in the cart dynamically, updating the total bill every time the user adds, removes, or changes the quantity of items in the cart.
  *The total bill is displayed prominently at the bottom of the cart, helping users stay aware of their expenses as they shop.
5.Responsive Design:
  *The website is fully responsive, ensuring a consistent and optimized user experience across different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop computers.
  *The layout adapts to smaller screens without losing functionality, making it convenient for users to shop on any device.
